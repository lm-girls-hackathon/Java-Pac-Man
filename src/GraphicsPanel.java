// Description: This class is the main class for this project.  It extends the Jpanel class and will be drawn on
// 				on the JPanel in the GraphicsMain class.

// Since you will modify this class you should add comments that describe when and how you modified the class.

		// action performed method every 5 milliseconds once the 
		// timer is started. You can change how frequently this
		// method is called by changing the first parameter.
		timer.start();

	// method: paintComponent
	// description: This method will paint the items onto the graphics panel.  This method is called when the panel is
	//   			first rendered.  It can also be called by this.repaint(). You'll want to draw each of your objects.
	//				This is the only place that you can draw objects.
	// parameters: Graphics g - This object is used to draw your images onto the graphics panel.
	public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
		Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;
		pacman.draw(g2, this);
	}

	// method:clock
	// description: This method is called by the clocklistener every 5 milliseconds.  You should update the coordinates
	//				of one of your characters in this method so that it moves as time changes.  After you update the
	//				coordinates you should repaint the panel. 
	public void clock(){
		// You can move any of your objects by calling their move methods.

		// You can also check to see if two objects intersect like this. In this case if the sprite collides with the
		// item, the item will get smaller. 
//		if(pacman.collision(item) && pacman.getY() < item.getY()) {
//			System.out.println("stop");
//			pacman.stop_Vertical();
//		}

		this.repaint();

	// method: keyPressed()
	// description: This method is called when a key is pressed. You can determine which key is pressed using the 
	//				KeyEvent object.  For example if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) would test to see if
	//				the left key was pressed.
	// parameters: KeyEvent e
	@Override
	public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {

		if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT)
			pacman.moveRight();
		else if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT)
			pacman.moveLeft();
		else if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_UP)
			pacman.jump();	
	}


	// method: keyTyped()
	// description: This method is called when a key is pressed and released. It basically combines the keyPressed and
	//              keyReleased functions.  You can determine which key is typed using the KeyEvent object.  
	//				For example if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) would test to see if the left key was typed.
	//				You probably don't want to do much in this method, but instead want to implement the keyPresses and keyReleased methods.
	// parameters: KeyEvent e
	@Override
	public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {


	}

	// method: keyReleased()
	// description: This method is called when a key is released. You can determine which key is released using the 
	//				KeyEvent object.  For example if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) would test to see if
	//				the left key was pressed.
	// parameters: KeyEvent e
	@Override
	public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {		
			//pacman.stop();
	}
